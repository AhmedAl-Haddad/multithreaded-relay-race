# Multithreaded Relay Race Simulation

This project simulates a 4x4x100 meter relay race using multithreading in C++. It demonstrates synchronization techniques such as barriers, mutexes, and condition variables.

## Features
- Simulates a 4x4x100 meter relay race.
- Uses multithreading to model each runner in the race.
- Implements thread-safe synchronization using barriers, mutexes, and condition variables.
- Tracks team times and disqualifications.
